Before you try to add a new BMM, make sure its compilation and execution is correct in stand-alone mode.

1.- Create a new folder here and copy all the new BMM classes
2.- You may have to implement a new Interface to the BMM (inherit vtkBiomechanicalModel). Place it in /src/Scenario and add the source file to the CMakeLists.txt in the src/Scenario Folder.
3.- Add Subdirs command to the CMakeLists.txt located in this folder
 * SUBDIRS('BMMName')
4.- Add the following lines to the vtkESQui root CmakeLists.txt:
 * INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/BMM/BMMName)
5.- Optionally, You may want to add functionality to the SRML Importer (src/Utilities/vtkSRMLImporter).
