\subsection{Detailed Description}
The \hyperlink{classImmSurgicalWorkstationFactory}{ImmSurgicalWorkstationFactory} class is responsible for creating and destroying \hyperlink{classImmSurgicalWorkstation}{ImmSurgicalWorkstation} objects. It is entirely composed of static methods. There is an AcquireSW method for each kind of interface. There is a single Release method for destroying previously acquired \hyperlink{classImmSurgicalWorkstation}{ImmSurgicalWorkstation} objects.

The \hyperlink{classImmSurgicalWorkstationFactory}{ImmSurgicalWorkstationFactory} class is not thread-\/safe. You must perform locking and synchronization on your own.
