Distribution
------------
This ESQUI Project distribution contains the following folders:

- Tcl: Tcl code to run the software GUI (main.tcl) and modules.
- Doc: Html doxygen documentation (sorry, right now in spanish.
SOON in English)
- misc: Python scripts used to exchange virtual models with Blender.
- src: Contains the vtk-C++ source code. This classes are organized as
follows:
	- ColDetect: Source code for collision detection.
	- Colisions: Source code for managing the collisions.
	- Comun: Useful code for ESQUI.
	- Haptic: Code to control/include Haptics devices.
	- BEM: Mathematical functions.
	- Tools: Code for surgical tools management.
	- T2Mesh: Source code of the Biomechanic model.
	- Wrapping: Wrapper for Tcl.

	
Install
-------
ESQUI has been developed using vtk 4.4.2 and tcl/tk 8.4.13. This
distribution has been tested under windows XP (VS7) and linux(gcc).
Please, if you have any problem with your building process, contact
to {marf,rsantana}@ctm.ulpgc.es.
 
To install ESQUI you need to compile using the cross-platform 
development tool CMake (http://www.cmake.org).	

Compiling
---------
This software has been tested under windows and linux. To compile
it you have to follow the next steps (a vtk project building):

1- Download the source code: 20060904ESQui.tgz
2- Extract it using winzip (windows) or tar command (tar zxvf file.tgz)
under unix.
3- Create a ESQUiBin folder and run ccmake in:

	ccmake <path of ESQUI Source code>

	i.e.(under linux): /<path>/ESQUibin/ccmake ../ESQUI
	if ESQUI is in <path>.

4- Follow the ccmake configuration. Remember to set the VTK_DIR
path (the folder where you have compiled vtk and you have your
VTKConfig.cmake file), and the Tcl/Tk libraries path.
If you want to use the software with haptics (LWS-Immersion Corp), please
set the CMake variable VTKESQUI_USE_HAPTICS to ON.
The wrapping and other configuration are done by default (they
are included in the CMakelist.txt file).
5- Make the vtk-project

	i.e. (under linux) /<path>/ESQUIbin/make

6- You shouldn't have any error. If you have any problem, please
let us know.
7- Set the environment variables: LD_LIBRARY_PATH and TCLLIBPATH to
the path where are the (.so/dlls) vtk/wrapping libraries.
If you have other Tcl/Tk versions, you should declare the TK_LIBRARY
and TCL_LIBRARY variables.

	i.e. (under linux) 

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/vtk-4.4.2/02build-VisualizationTool
kit-4.4.2/bin/:/home/marf/software/ESQUI/EsquiBin/bin/

export TCLLIBPATH=/home/marf/software/ESQUI/ESQUI/Wrapping/Tcl

8- Execute <path ESQUI source Code>/Tcl/main.tcl using your vtk
version.
In the file "quickstart.pdf/.odt" you can find a short guide to run a simple
example.	 

=====================================================================================================
Important note under Linux: We have found a bug when compiling the 
STL libraries under Linux using the GCC 4.0.4 compiler. To avoid 
this bug, use another version of the compiler (i.e. GCC 3) or fix
it (you have to remove "stl::" in some lines).
