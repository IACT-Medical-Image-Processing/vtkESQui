Distribution
------------
ESQUI is a vtk-based software project. The distribution follows the standard
structure for vtk's projects.

This ESQUI release includes the following folders:

-BMM: Biomechanical models coded under vtk classes.  
-CDM: Collision detection models coded under vtk classes.
-Common: General vtk classes needed by the project.
-Doxygen: Documentation of the code.
-Examples: A list of examples under C++ and Tcl.
-Haptics: vtk classes that wrap the haptic's API. 
-Manager: vtk classes that manage the software pipeline.
-Scenario: vtk classes that manage the rendered's objects.
-Utilities: Scripts and C++ classes to share/export/import models from
other packages used in ESQUi (i.e. Blender).
-Wrapping: The vtk's code for wrapping under Tcl.
	
Install
-------
In order to use this software the following packages must be installed:

 * VTK. version > 5.6
 * Tcl/Tk. version > 8.4
 * CMake. version > 2.5

This software has been compiled and tested in:

 * Windows (Visual Studio 2005 and Visual Studio 2008) 
 * Unix (gcc > 4.4).

Compiling
---------
This software has been tested under windows and linux. To compile it you 
need to follow the next steps (a vtk project building):

1- Download the source code.
2- Create a ESQUiBin folder and run ccmake in:

	ccmake <path of ESQUI Source code>

	i.e.(under linux): /<path>/ESQUibin/ccmake ../ESQUI
	if ESQUI is in <path>.

3- Follow the ccmake configuration. Remind to set the VTK_DIR
path (the folder where you have compiled vtk and you have your
VTKConfig.cmake file), and the Tcl/Tk libraries path.
If you would like to use the software with haptics (LWS-Immersion Corp, 
IHP,etc), please set the CMake variable VTKESQUI_USE_HAPTICS to ON.
The wrapping and other configuration are done by default (they
are included in the CMakelist.txt file).
4- Make the vtk-project

	i.e. (under linux) /<path>/ESQUIbin/make

5- You shouldn't get any error. If you have any problem, please
let us know.
7- Set the environment variables: LD_LIBRARY_PATH and TCLLIBPATH to
the path where are the (.so/dlls) vtk/wrapping libraries.
If you have other Tcl/Tk versions, you should declare the TK_LIBRARY
and TCL_LIBRARY variables.

	i.e. (under linux) 

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/vtk-5.4:/home/marf/software/ESQUI/EsquiBin/bin/

export TCLLIBPATH=/home/marf/software/ESQUI/ESQUI/Wrapping/Tcl

8- See the Examples folder to run applications that use the package.

In the file "quickstart.pdf/.odt" you can find a short guide to run 
a simple example.
