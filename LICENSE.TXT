This software has been proposed, managed and advised by Miguel Angel 
Rodriguez Florido (ITC and CTM-ULPGC). 

The first version of the package was implemented by the Bachelor Thesis of 
Norberto Sanchez Escobar. Some Improvements of this package were done by 
the Master Thesis of Graciela Santana Sosa, both at the CTM-ULPGC lab supported by the Institute of Technology (ITC). Also, Raul Santana (CTM-ULPGC) developed code for this package.

The final stable version of the package, with a new design and structure,
has been implemented by Jorge Ballesteros (member of the MOTIVA and funded
by the local foundation of health (FUNCIS)) and the ITC.

At this moment, this software is supported by the Institute of Technology at
Canary Islands (ITC) under the innovation plan MOTIVA (http://motivando.me).
